# WLAC
Ecological code repository for West Los Angeles College.

The following instructions are for getting the data needed to run the species distribution modeling script [Marine_SDM.R](https://github.com/levisimons/WLAC/blob/main/Marine_SDM.R).

# To install R and R Studio
Following the tutorial here: [R and R Studio tutorial](https://alexd106.github.io/intro2R/setup.html).

# Getting biological data
## Go to [https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/search](https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/search)
## Set query filters
### Occurrence status: present
### Scientific name: Macrocystis pyrifera .  Note: Giant kelp, test example
### Location: including coordinates
### Administrative area: California
### Time: 2010 - 2020
## A download link will be generated.  The output file will be a tab-delimited CSV file.
### Example output file for Macrocystis pyrifera: [macrocystis_pyrifera.csv](https://github.com/levisimons/WLAC/blob/main/macrocystis_pyrifera.csv)

# Defining the study area
## Got to download the shapefile for [3-Nautical Mile Coastal Boundary, California, 2001](https://earthworks.stanford.edu/catalog/stanford-sg211gq3741).
### Relevant shapefile data is initially in the directory sg211gq3741/data_EPSG_4326 , move it to the same directory as the [script](https://github.com/levisimons/WLAC/blob/main/Marine_SDM.R).
### Within [Marine_SDM.R](https://github.com/levisimons/WLAC/blob/main/Marine_SDM.R) clip the coastal boundary zone of California to the extent of the Southnern California Bight. Northwestern point of study area is Point Conception (34.4486째 N, 120.4716째 W), southeastern point is Tijuana Beach Promenade (32.5340째 N, 117.1235째 W)
